        <h2>Studio Light Basics</h2>
		
		<p id="studio"> Studio light photography is a great way to expand your portfolio and learn about the importance of lighting and the correct camera settings. With this video, you will learn basic skills such as metering your key light, positioning your camera and subject, and more. During my time at Illinois State University, I was able to learn a little bit about studio lighting, but I also practiced it a lot on my own. Videos such as this one, really helped me learn basic techniques and find my own style with time. </p>

				<h3>Lillie </h3>

				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with my dear friend Lillie to create a minimalist look that was simple, yet professional looking. I worked with positioning two studio lights precisely so a very faint shadow would appear behind my subject. The white backdrop is one of my favorites to work with since you can use lighting to manipulate the shadows of your subject as you see fit. </p>

				<h3>Alan</h3>

				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with Alan to create a very dark and moody composition. I worked with studio lighting to help cast the light on a specific part of my subject so lots of shadows would appear around them. This lighting helped with highlighting my subjects face and creating a very stark contrast with the black backdrop used. This was one of my first times using a black backdrop and I felt it helped create a specific mood and tone for my photos. </p>

				<h3>Safa</h3>
				<img src="ISIMG-1064450 1 copy 3.png" alt="Safa">
				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked on taking self-portraits of myself. This was the first time I had ever taken studio shots, therefore there was a lot of trial and error that took place. I only worked with one studio light and positioned it high above myself to help create shadows behind me, instead of anywhere else. Though I am not a fan of taking self-portraits, this shoot allowed me to play around with lighting at my own pace. </p>
