        <h2>Canon Camera Basics</h2>
		
		<p id="camera"> The most important part of being a photographer is knowing how to use a camera. Choosing a camera, whether itâ€™s a Canon or a Nikon, is up to your personal preference. I have always used a Canon and it has never failed me as an artist. Canon also offers multiple types of digital cameras to fit your needs. This video allows users to understand the basics of using a digital Canon camera so you can be on your way to becoming a skilled photographer. </p>

				<h3>Lillie </h3>

				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with my dear friend Lillie to create a minimalist look that was simple, yet professional looking. I worked with positioning two studio lights precisely so a very faint shadow would appear behind my subject. The white backdrop is one of my favorites to work with since you can use lighting to manipulate the shadows of your subject as you see fit. </p>

				<h3>Alan</h3>

				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with Alan to create a very dark and moody composition. I worked with studio lighting to help cast the light on a specific part of my subject so lots of shadows would appear around them. This lighting helped with highlighting my subjects face and creating a very stark contrast with the black backdrop used. This was one of my first times using a black backdrop and I felt it helped create a specific mood and tone for my photos. </p>

				<h3>Safa</h3>

				</a>
				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked on taking self-portraits of myself. This was the first time I had ever taken studio shots, therefore there was a lot of trial and error that took place. I only worked with one studio light and positioned it high above myself to help create shadows behind me, instead of anywhere else. Though I am not a fan of taking self-portraits, this shoot allowed me to play around with lighting at my own pace. </p>
