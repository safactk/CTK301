		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p id="aboutme"> Hello All, <br>
			
		<br> My name is Safa Ahmad, and I am a Junior at Illinois State University majoring in graphic design. My love for art started when I was a child and continued to grow until I was passionate about adding my own unique touch to anything I created. <br>
			
		<br> Even though I love designing and playing around with color and typography, photography is my favorite form of art. Throughout all  four years of high school, I was able to take creative photography classes and expand my skills with a digital camera. When I started at Illinois State, I began to take black-and-white film photography and more digital photography courses. <br>
			
		<br> Throughout the past year, I have been expanding my portfolio and skills in studio photography. I enjoy taking photos of photos in a studio due to the control I have over the lighting, background, and positioning of my subjects. This portfolio will feature a few of my favorite studio shots taken within the past few semester. <br>
			
		<br> Sincerely, <br>
		Safa Ahmad </p>

				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with my dear friend Lillie to create a minimalist look that was simple, yet professional looking. I worked with positioning two studio lights precisely so a very faint shadow would appear behind my subject. The white backdrop is one of my favorites to work with since you can use lighting to manipulate the shadows of your subject as you see fit. </p>

				</a>
				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked with Alan to create a very dark and moody composition. I worked with studio lighting to help cast the light on a specific part of my subject so lots of shadows would appear around them. This lighting helped with highlighting my subjects face and creating a very stark contrast with the black backdrop used. This was one of my first times using a black backdrop and I felt it helped create a specific mood and tone for my photos. </p>

				</a>
				<p>For this photoshoot, I worked on taking self-portraits of myself. This was the first time I had ever taken studio shots, therefore there was a lot of trial and error that took place. I only worked with one studio light and positioned it high above myself to help create shadows behind me, instead of anywhere else. Though I am not a fan of taking self-portraits, this shoot allowed me to play around with lighting at my own pace. </p>
